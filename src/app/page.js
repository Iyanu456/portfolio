						Hi, {`I'm`} <b>Iyanu</b>, and I really enjoy technology and coding. {`I'm`} currently learning how to use React and Next.js, which help me make websites look great and work smoothly.
						<br /><br />
						{`I'm`} also a student at ALX, where {`I'm`} learning more about software engineering. {`I'm`}still in the process of learning and growing in the tech world.
						<br />
						Whether {`I'm`}writing code or working on web projects, I love making things that can make a positive difference. I believe that every project is a chance to learn and make the world a bit better.
						<br /><br/>If {`you're`} into tech and coding too, {`let's`} chat about some cool projects we can work on together! You can check out my portfolio to see my work.
